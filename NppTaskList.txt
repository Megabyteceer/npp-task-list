Change summary for attempts to fix the overwrite problem

1 - recompiled existing code in x64.  My DLL appears to match the existing 2.4 release DLL.
2 - replaced the following include files:
	Docking.h - REVERTED
	DockingDlgInterface.h - REVERTED (NEEDED because new would required access to static DarkMode namespace items)
	menuCmdID.h - UNNECESSARY?
	Notpad_plus_msgs.h - HAS DM COMMUNICATION CODES!  NEEDED IF WE WANT DM NOTIFICATIONS
	Sci_position.h - REVERTED
	Scintilla.h - REVERTED (NEEDED because new would have buffer issues)
	StaticDialog.h - REVERTED
	URLCtrl.h - REVERTED
3 - replaced the following source files:
	StaticDialog.cpp - REVERTED
	URLCtrl.cpp - REVERTED
4 - added the following include files:
	NppDarkMode.h - HAS DM Colors struct -> DO I NEED IT?
5 - made changes to the following files:
	TaskList.rc - to version 2.5 and added contributor - OK
	resource.h - needed to add IDC for new contributor - OK


I have questions about the StaticDialog::alignWith function missing from 8.4 NPP code
	Doesn't appear to be called herein

TaskListDlg - both .h and .cpp - appears to be unrelated to the current TaskListDlg functions of NPP.  In my ideal world these would be renamed as TodoListDlg
AboutDlg - both .h and .cpp - appears also to be only peripherally related to AboutDlg functions of NPP.  No changes planned.
Window.h - license descriptor only changes to file so I skipped.
Common - both .h and .cpp - seems to be a completely truncated version of the NPP code keeping only 3 changed functions.

Can't handle static elements of DarkMode namespace!
Need to address issue with messages and notifications
